SimplePages -- Bootstrap compatible
==================
This forked project is simply a slightly modified version of the official [Omeka-developed SimplePages plugin](http://github.com/omeka/plugin-SimplePages). Wherever there was hard-coded output that didn't conform to the [Omeka Bootstrap theme's](http://github.com/gsbodine/omeka-bootstrap) needs, I've adjusted it. I try to keep this up-to-date with changes to the official project, and it should probably be noted that **this theme has been updated to support 2.0** and if you want to support Omeka 1.5, you'll need to check out the appropriate branch.
